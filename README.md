## Project Objective
The Retail Company with multiple outlets across the country are facing 
issues with inventory management. The task is to come up with useful 
insights using the provided data and make prediction models to forecast the 
sales of next twelve weeks

## Data Description
The available dataset contains total entries of 6,435*8 having 6,435 rows 
and eight columns. Data Description, various insights from the data.
From the given dataset of the retail company, it is observed that the data 
consists of six thousand four hundred and thirty-five (6,435) records with

## Data Pre-processing Steps and Inspiration
The pre-processing of the data included the following steps:
1. Step 1: Load Data
2. Step 2: Perform ***Exploratory Data Analysis***
    - Confirm number of records in the data and how they are distributed
    - Check data types
    - Check for missing data, invalid entries, duplicates
    - Examine the correlation of the independent features with the target (Weekly_Sales) variables.
    - Check for outliers that are known to distort predictions and forecasts.
3. Step 3: See relations between independent and dependent variables and make inferences.
4. Step 4: Model Predictions, two approaches:
    - Linear Regression Models.
    - Time Series Model (ARIMA, SARIMAX).
5. Step 5: Forecast
6. Step 6: Compare result from different models
